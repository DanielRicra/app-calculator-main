## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use make the change theme on a web page. I learned more about JS.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to use some functions on JS and some propertipes on css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://codepip.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand some thing of flex propertipe. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
